# Seismic Detection Across the Solar System
### By Luyu Wu - High School Student at University of Toronto Schools


## Problem Statement
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

## Approach
I decided to use a purely algorithmic approach to this challenge. This is due to my physics background and interest in finding solutions that are not machine learning (and thus black-box) based.
